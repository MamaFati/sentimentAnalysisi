# Analyzing Public Sentiment in COVID-19 Vaccination

This project analyzes public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccination by applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques on tweets collected from Twitter. Using Python, we preprocess text data, extract relevant features, and classify sentiments using **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes** classifiers.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover how people feel about COVID-19 vaccination by analyzing their tweets. Sentiment analysis allows us to automatically classify these opinions as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**, offering insight into public perception during the pandemic.

Key objectives include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw Twitter data
- Extracting useful features using NLP techniques
- Classifying sentiment using supervised learning algorithms
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics
- Visualizing the results and trends in public opinion
- Deploying an interactive web application using **Streamlit**
